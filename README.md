playground
==========

A place to play around with random code projects that don't warrant their own space.

####js\paginator.js

An easy to use jQuery bootstrap pagination plugin.


####MythTV\mythtranscode.sh

A MythTV transcoding user job to mkv

Note: I need to eventually convert from bash to python so that I can access the myth api function to delete a recording once transcoded.
